## 3. Workflow Rules

### 3.1 Skill Assignment
- Each ticket in `docs/TICKETS.md` has a `**Skill:**` field — use that skill when working on the ticket.
- Use `skill` tool to load the skill instructions before starting work.

### 3.2 Design Reference
- **`DESIGN_FILES/`** is the visual source of truth. Each HTML file in that folder is the exact pixel spec for its screen.
- `DESIGN.md` at the project root is the derived design system reference — keep it in sync with `DESIGN_FILES/`.
- When building a screen, open its corresponding HTML file in `DESIGN_FILES/` first to match layout, colors, spacing, typography, and component states.

### 3.3 Document Conventions
- All docs live in `docs/` folder.
- File length limit: each code file ≤300 LOC.
- Write code only to spec. Minimum, not maximum. One simple solution. Clarify, don't assume.

### 3.4 Code Style
- TypeScript strict mode.
- CSS Modules + CSS custom properties (no runtime CSS-in-JS).
- React functional components with hooks.
- Clean Architecture: UI never imports `better-sqlite3` directly.

### 3.5 Session Logging
- Append to `session_log.md` after every change.
- Format: `## Session YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` → `### Changes` → `### Skill(s) Used` → `### Status`

### 3.6 AGENTS.md Management
- Check this file at the start of every conversation — especially §5 for the current ticket.
- Update if new conventions or files are introduced.
