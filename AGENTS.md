## 3. Workflow Rules

### 3.1 Skill Assignment
- Each ticket in `docs/TICKETS.md` has a `**Skill:**` field — use that skill when working on the ticket.
- Use `skill` tool to load the skill instructions before starting work.

### 3.2 Design Reference
- **`DESIGN_FILES/`** is the visual source of truth. Each HTML file in that folder is the exact pixel spec for its screen.
- `DESIGN.md` at the project root is the derived design system reference — keep it in sync with `DESIGN_FILES/`.
- When building a screen, open its corresponding HTML file in `DESIGN_FILES/` first to match layout, colors, spacing, typography, and component states.

### 3.3 Document Conventions
- All docs live in `docs/` folder.
- File length limit: each code file ≤300 LOC.
- Write code only to spec. Minimum, not maximum. One simple solution. Clarify, don't assume.

### 3.4 Code Style
- TypeScript strict mode.
- CSS Modules + CSS custom properties (no runtime CSS-in-JS).
- React functional components with hooks.
- Clean Architecture: UI never imports `better-sqlite3` directly.

### 3.5 Session Start Ritual
- **At the start of EVERY session**, read `session_log.md` (last entry for current position) and this file §5 (current ticket).
- This ensures you always know what was built, what failed, and what's next — even after a fresh start.

### 3.6 Context Management
- Monitor context usage. When context is approaching ~80%, STOP work immediately.
- Before stopping: stage all changes, `git commit`, update `session_log.md`, update this file §5 to the next ticket.
- This enables the user to always start a fresh session from a clean checkpoint.

### 3.7 Session Logging
- Append to `session_log.md` after every change.
- Format: `## Session YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` → `### Changes` → `### Skill(s) Used` → `### Status`
- Each entry MUST clearly state what was completed and what the next ticket is.
- This is the primary handoff mechanism for fresh sessions — make it thorough.

### 3.8 AGENTS.md Management
- Check this file (§3 and §5) at the start of every conversation.
- Update if new conventions or files are introduced.
- Update §5 to the next ticket after completing each ticket.

## 4. Session Logs

See `session_log.md` for complete session history.

## 5. Current Ticket / Next Up

**All 42 original tickets done.** Now in Phase 6 — Dynamic Configuration & Hardening.

**Completed Phase 6 thus far:**
- T-043: App settings store (`useSettingsStore.ts` + `AppSettings.ts`) with locale, currency, primary member, constants persisted to localStorage
- T-044: Dynamic currency from settings — `formatAmount()` utility + replaced all hardcoded `'BDT'` in all screens
- T-045: Dynamic locale from settings — `useFormatNumber()` hook + replaced all raw `Intl.NumberFormat` calls in TransactionWizard, all screens use `formatAmount()` with locale from store
- T-046: Removed hardcoded `'Efty'` from Loans screen — reads actual lender name via account→member lookup
- T-047: Extracted duplicated MONTH/day arrays into `src/presentation/constants/dates.ts` — `shortDate()` now locale-aware via `Intl.DateTimeFormat`, 4 duplicate definitions removed
- T-048: Extracted account type / transaction type labels into `src/presentation/constants/labels.ts` — `ACCOUNT_TYPE_LABEL`, `ACCOUNT_TYPE_GRADIENT`, `ACCOUNT_TYPE_ACCENT`, `TX_TYPE_ICON`, `displayType()`; replaced 6+ hardcoded maps across components and screens
- T-049: Replaced all inline `style={{...}}` with CSS module classes or CSS custom properties — 12 files updated, only shadcn/ui `select.tsx` remains
- T-050: Extracted magic number constants into `src/presentation/constants/config.ts` — defaults and min/max bounds for descriptionMaxLength, numpadMaxDigits, dashboardTxLimit

**All 50 tickets complete.** Phase 6 — Dynamic Configuration & Hardening is finished.

**Phase 7: Unified Loan System** — 9 tickets (T-051–T-059). See `docs/TICKETS.md` for full details.

| Ticket | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| T-051 | Scaffold `src/loans/` folder + move types + public API | **Complete** |
| T-052 | Rewrite loan schema + database layer | **Complete** |
| T-053 | Rewrite `LoanService.ts` — unified core logic | **Complete** |
| T-054 | Rewrite `useLoanStore.ts` | **Complete** |
| T-055 | Build unified `LoanForm.tsx` + `AddCounterparty.tsx` | **Complete** |
| T-056 | Rewrite `LoansScreen.tsx` + `LoanDetailView.tsx` | **Complete** |
| T-057 | Update `TransactionDetailModal` + simplify `TransactionFormModal` | **Complete** |
| T-058 | Update routing, Dashboard, MemberProfile, cross-references | **Complete** |
| T-059 | Delete all old loan code and obsolete files | **Complete** |

**All 59 tickets complete.** Phase 7 — Unified Loan System is finished.

**Next: Phase 8** — TBD (post-refactor testing / new feature work).

**Context rule reminder:** At ~80% context, STOP → stage → commit → update session_log + this file → hand off for fresh session.

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **money_flows_v0.4** (1278 symbols, 2537 relationships, 78 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> Index stale? Run `node .gitnexus/run.cjs analyze` from the project root — it auto-selects an available runner. No `.gitnexus/run.cjs` yet? `npx gitnexus analyze` (npm 11 crash → `npm i -g gitnexus`; #1939).

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows. For regression review, compare against the default branch: `detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "main"})`.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `query({search_query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `context({name: "symbolName"})`.
- For security review, `explain({target: "fileOrSymbol"})` lists taint findings (source→sink flows; needs `analyze --pdg`).

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `detect_changes()` to check affected scope.
