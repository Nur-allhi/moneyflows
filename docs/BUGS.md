# MoneyFlows — Bug Tracker

Living queue of known issues. Maintained per the BUG TRACKING PROTOCOL (AGENTS.md §3.11).

## Ordering rules (maintain this file exactly so)

1. `open` and `in-progress` bugs always sort above `fixed` and `wontfix`.
2. Within the same status, sort by severity: `critical` → `high` → `medium` → `low`.
3. Within the same status + severity, sort by found date, oldest first.
4. `fixed`/`wontfix` entries stay at the bottom as history, in the same severity/date order.

## Entry template

```markdown
## BUG-<sequential-id>: <short title>

- **Status:** open | in-progress | fixed | wontfix
- **Severity:** critical | high | medium | low
- **Found:** YYYY-MM-DD (during: <what surfaced it>)
- **Location:** <file(s)/component/route affected>
- **Description:** What's wrong; observed vs. expected behavior.
- **Root Cause:** (unknown until diagnosed)
- **Fix Approach:** (only after user confirms the approach)
- **Resolved:** YYYY-MM-DD — commit/PR reference

## BUG-2: App "restarts" while creating a new account under a member

- **Status:** open
- **Severity:** high
- **Found:** 2026-08-24 (during: user manual test report)
- **Location:** Add-Account flow (MemberProfile → AddAccountModal → `saveAccount`)
- **Description:** User reports the app appeared to restart/reload while creating a new account under a member. Expected: account created in-place, no reload. Observed: app seemingly restarted (exact conditions unknown — possibly dev-server reloads during recent heavy editing vs a real runtime defect).
- **Root Cause:** unknown — reproduction in progress
- **Fix Approach:** pending diagnosis + owner confirmation
- **Resolved:** —

## BUG-1: Real family names and financial PDF persist in tracked docs and git history

- **Status:** fixed
- **Severity:** high
- **Found:** 2026-08-24 (during: full-project PII name audit requested by owner)
- **Location:** `Project_plan/Financial_Review.md` (25 hits), `Project_plan/*.md`, `DESIGN_FILES/*.html`, `DESIGN.md`, `docs/PRD.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `session_log.md`, and **git history**: PDF blob added in `f9f802a`, removed at HEAD by `68f3771`, still reachable from `master`
- **Description:** SECURITY.md §5 forbids real person names tied to financial figures. Full names were present across 14+ tracked files and an exported loan-ledger PDF remained extractable from history. Runtime code was already clean.
- **Root Cause:** Scaffolding docs authored from the family's real spreadsheet audit; mockups reused real member names; data PDF slipped into one fix commit before `.gitignore` covered `USER_DATA/`.
- **Fix Approach:** owner-approved Option B2 — full `git filter-repo` rewrite on a mirror clone: USER_DATA paths purged + all family/counterparty names replaced with role placeholders across every commit; all refs force-pushed.
- **Resolved:** 2026-08-24 — history rewrite (all SHAs replaced; pre-rewrite backup bundle `C:\Dev_Projects\moneyflows-backup-pre-rewrite.bundle`; post-rewrite scan shows 0 tracked files with real names). Residual platform caveat documented in `docs/audit/PII_NAMES_AUDIT_2026-08-24.md` §7.
